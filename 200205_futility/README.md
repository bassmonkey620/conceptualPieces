# Futilitty #
## Concept ##
As we trace our paths through we turn, fall back, and intersect with the lives and legacies of others. Futile persistence creates meaning, and out of the struggle between the two, we find community, legacy, and society.
## Process ##
The piece starts with 100 faint white lines, the paths of individuals, placed randomly about the space. From the endpoint of each line, a choice of 8 directions is given. If the individual turns back, they erase the line they just placed. By circling over their own path or intersecting with the paths of others, individuals can make their lives more and more visibile. The space will never be completely filled forever, nor will it ever completely disappear, as there will always be a chance to go forward or backward.
